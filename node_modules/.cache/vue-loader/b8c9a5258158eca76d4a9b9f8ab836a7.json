What many people don’t acknowledge is that Wikipedia involves a huge community of people. They actually work full time or part-time with their lives in result to supply Wikipedia with knowledge. The Wikipedians are humans, not bots. In fact, the articles we read, are being edited by volunteers around the world, aka the Wikipedians. The Wikipedians form a culture. This culture is analysed and categorised into communities of practice. Wikipedians are simple people like me and you and everyone else around you. They form the back-end side of Wikipedia, where there is a world of support, brotherhood, exchange of knowledge and vandalism. Who are those people, what are their motives?\n      In this publication, you will find extensive research with sources about the user’s community on Wikipedia and evolution.\n\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<style>\n.about {\n  width: 100%;\n  margin-top: 5%;\n}\n</style>\n"]}]}
